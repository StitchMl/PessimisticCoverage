# PessimisticCoverage - Exercise **Software Engineering and Web Design** - Tor Vergata

This repository contains a project developed as an exercise for the **Software Engineering and Web Design** course held at the University of Tor Vergata in 2022.

The aim of the project is to implement and analyse a pessimistic coverage model in an application context, using advanced software development practices learnt during the course.

## Project Structure
The project is organised in several key sections, which follow the logical flow of software design, implementation and testing:

1. **Documentation**
   - Requirements Specifications
   - UML Diagrams (Use Case, Class Diagram, Sequence Diagram)

2. **Source Code**
   - Implementation of the pessimistic coverage model
   - Application logic structured according to modular design principles

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Unit Testing
   - Integration Testing

4. **Execution**
   - Start-up and configuration scripts

## Prerequisites
To run the project, you must have the following tools installed:
  - Java 11 or later versions
  - An integrated development environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse or NetBeans
  - Apache Maven for dependency management (optional)

## Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/StitchMl/PessimisticCoverage.git
   cd PessimisticCoverage
   ```
2. Import the project into an IDE:
   - Open the IDE and select the option to import a Maven project or a standard Java project.
   - Configure dependencies if necessary.

3. Compile and run the project:
   - Compile the project using the Maven command:
     ```
     mvn clean install
     ```
   - Or use the functionality of the IDE to compile and execute the main file.
